<h1>AffdexMe</h1>
<p><strong>Affdex SDK</strong> is the culmination of years of scientific research into emotion detection, validated across thousands of tests worldwide on PC platforms, and now made available as a software development kit for Windows. Affdex SDK turns your ordinary app into an extraordinary app by emotion-enabling it to respond in real-time to user emotions.</p>
<p><strong>AffdexMe</strong> is a windows application that demonstrates the use of the Affdex SDK for Windows.  It uses the camera on your Windows PC to view, process and analyze live video of your face.
Start the app and you will see your own face on the screen, and metrics describing your expressions.</p>
<h4>This app includes the following command buttons:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Start - Starts the camera processing.</li>
<li>Reset - Resets the context of the video frames.</li>
<li>ShowPoints/HidePoints  - toggles the display of facial feature points, which Affdex uses to detect expressions.</li>
<li>Stop - Stops the camera processing.</li>
<li>Exit - exits the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>This application runs on Windows 7.0, 8.0 and 8.1</p>
<h4>To use this project, you will need:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Visual Studio 2013</p>
